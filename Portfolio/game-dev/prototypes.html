    <h2>Most Recent Projects</h2>
    <h3>Cyber Nexus</h3>
    <p>
      Cyber Nexus is a character-swapping puzzle-environmental narrative game
      set in a high-tech research facility researching a revolutionary radiation
      cure. Players take control of Wisp and Aurora, two distinct characters,
      and must switch between them to overcome environmental challenges, solve
      intricate puzzles, and navigate the facility while finding out what
      happened to shut the facility down.

    <h3>Divers Descent</h3>
    <p>
      DiversDescent is a 2D platformer I created where I designed all the
      assets, from character animations to enemies, backgrounds, and power-ups.
      The game follows a marine biologist who stumbles upon a powerful energy
      source, which causes irregularities and hybrid mutations in the ocean.
      These mutations result in dangerous new creatures, including starfish-sea
      urchin, lionfish-pufferfish, and octopus-crab hybrids, that the diver must
      face as she embarks on her mission to retrieve the energy crystals and
      restore balance. As players navigate through underwater worlds, they
      encounter challenging platforming sequences, solve puzzles, and battle
      mutated sea creatures. With a strong focus on world-building and
      environmental storytelling, DiversDescent immerses players in a unique,
      hand-crafted oceanic world filled with danger and discovery.

    <h3>Ratsky's Adventures - A working Title</h3>
    <p>
      Ratsky Adventures (working title) is my latest project, a historical,
      environmental narrative stealth and heist game where players control
      Ratsky, a small but determined rat reclaiming stolen artifacts from the
      Brattish Museum and returning them to their rightful origins. The game
      blends stealth, parkour, and historical storytelling, offering an
      experience that challenges players to navigate complex spaces while
      uncovering hidden histories. This project is more than just a game—it's a
      way for me to refine my coding skills, experiment with immersive design,
      and push my understanding of game mechanics. As someone who loves
      environmental storytelling and games like Assassin’s Creed, I’m focusing
      on crafting a world that feels alive, rich with detail, and deeply
      engaging.

    <h2>Other Projects</h2>
    <h3>Inventory System</h3>
    <p>
      One of my first coding projects was a fruit shop inventory simulation,
      where I built a basic system to manage inventory and funds using 2D Unity.
      This project helped me develop a foundational understanding of coding
      logic, resource management, and game systems. The simulation allowed
      players to track stock levels, sell items, and balance their funds,
      reinforcing key concepts like UI interactions, data management, and game
      economy mechanics. While simple, it was an important step in improving my
      coding skills and learning how to structure game systems effectively.

    <h3>Space AirHockey</h3>
    <p>
      Another one of my early coding projects was Space Air Hockey, a simple yet
      engaging 2D game built in Unity. This project focused on colliders,
      physics interactions, and fundamental coding mechanics, helping me improve
      my understanding of Unity’s physics system and how to create smooth-ish,
      responsive gameplay. By implementing collision detection, paddle movement,
      and scoring systems, I gained hands-on experience in handling game
      objects, scripting behaviors, and fine-tuning player interactions. While a
      small project, it was a crucial step in building my confidence with Unity
      and coding, setting the foundation for more complex game development.
