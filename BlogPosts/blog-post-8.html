  <p class="intext-title">Digital Inequalities and Why They Matter</p>

  <p class="p-name" >
   In Digital Inequalities and Why They Matter, Robinson et al. (2015) argue that digital inequality extends far beyond whether someone has internet access. it is also about what individuals can do with digital technology, how they engage with it, and how their skills develop over time. The authors present a layered framework for understanding digital inequality as something that both reflects and deepens existing social disparities. Reading this piece made me reflect critically on my position, my privileges, but also my ongoing frustrations, and how digital inequality impacts not only students like me, but especially those who never get the opportunity to attend university in the first place.

</p>
   <div class="space"></div>
<p>Robinson et al. (2015, p. 570) writes that “digital inequality stems from structural inequalities,” and this made me pause. Currently, I am in the middle of a Wi-Fi switchover, and I still don’t know when I’ll have stable access again, despite being in regular contact with the service providers. This disruption has already made it difficult to meet deadlines and continue with my academic work. I’ve had to buy expensive mobile data just to stay afloat. Even with a smartphone, a laptop, and digital literacy, this process has been stressful and costly. And if this is difficult for me, someone with access to devices, support, and some financial flexibility. How much more difficult must it be for someone who has none of these things?
  <div class="space"></div>

  <p class="p-name" ><br>
   This personal frustration echoes the idea that digital inequality is not a one-time barrier but a “cumulative process” shaped by long-term access, support, and exposure (Robinson et al., 2015, p. 575). I’ve had internet access since primary school, so I’ve had years to become comfortable with digital tools. I realise now that this was a huge advantage. I’ve encountered classmates who struggle with things like Microsoft Word or submitting online forms, not because they are lazy, but because they simply haven’t had the same opportunities to practise and learn. Yet these tools are often treated as “basic,” with no formal instruction provided. Digital literacy is assumed, not taught, and that assumption is both dangerous and unfair.  <div class="space"></div>
  
 
   <div class="space"></div>
  </div>
 
  <div class="e-content">
    <p>
    Even more concerning is the fact that digital inequality can prevent people from ever reaching higher education. As Robinson et al. (2015, p. 576) highlight, structural gaps in digital access often go unaddressed by policy, leaving already-marginalised individuals further behind. I think about learners in rural areas, students from under-resourced schools, or individuals whose families can’t afford devices or stable internet. How are they supposed to apply for university, access study materials, or even research future options? The idea of “equal opportunity” is misleading when so many people are starting from completely different points on the map, both literally and figuratively.

  </p>
    <div class="space"></div>
    <p>Universities like Wits do offer some support, such as access to on-campus Wi-Fi, student email accounts, and computer literacy workshops, but these interventions come after a student has gained entry. As Robinson et al. (2015, p. 571) argue, digital access must be understood within broader “social locations,” including class, race, and geography. This means that the digital gap is about more than technology; it is a social justice issue. Community-wide initiatives are needed. Why can’t we set up public access hubs in local libraries, community centres, or even school campuses after hours? Why can’t there be national programs to redistribute used devices or provide free or subsidised data plans? If digital participation is now essential to economic, academic, and social life, then access should be treated as a public utility, not a private burden.</p>

 <p class="p-name"></p>
  <div class="e-content">
    <p>Robinson et al. (2015) succeed in showing that digital inequality is deeply rooted in broader systems of privilege and exclusion. Their call to consider the quality of digital engagement, not just access, is especially powerful. I’m grateful for the digital resources I do have, but I also feel deeply uncomfortable knowing how fragile that access is, and how many people are shut out entirely. Being without Wi-Fi this week has given me a glimpse into what digital exclusion feels like, even temporarily, and it’s made me more aware of how unjust and isolating that experience can be. </p>
     <div class="space"></div>
    <p>Ultimately, Robinson et al. (2015) offer more than a theoretical framework; they offer a call to action. Reading this text and reflecting on my circumstances has convinced me that digital inequality is one of the most urgent justice issues of our time. If we are serious about inclusion, empowerment, and opportunity, then we must also be serious about ensuring meaningful digital access for all.</p>  <div class="space"></div>
