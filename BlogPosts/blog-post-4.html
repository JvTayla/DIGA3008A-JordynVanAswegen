     <p class="intext-title">Design Section Implementation</p>

<p>During our class on Thursday, I had spoken to Hanli, and she mentioned adding image folders for each of my sections to help with Optimization and organisation, and I took her advice, and my website's folder structure has been edited to include graphic sections, supporting efficient image management and navigation. I didn’t have a design section beforehand and it’s a requirement for our Assignment 1, so I fixed this and now the design section is live, including dedicated pages for documenting the IxD processes, showcasing the style guide, and presenting wireframe designs. Because of all these changes I've had to ensure that all internal links have been updated to align with the revised folder structure and ensure consistent navigation, so everything works again! Yayy!
</p>

 <p class="p-name" >  Wireframe Development: Desktop and Mobile    

<p>This weekend was focused on creating distinct wireframe versions for desktop and mobile platforms. The mobile wireframe prioritizes a responsive user experience through a streamlined interface, incorporating a dropdown menu for primary navigation and a simplified header/footer design than my desktop version. Im currently doing more Research to find cool mobile-specific features that can enhance engagement beyond basic touch interactions, like on desktop with the hover mechanics. In my comment reply to this blog, I will link my Desktop version and my Mobile version. <a href = ../Design/wireframes/index.html class="brand-link" > Wireframes </a>

</section>
 
<section> <p class="p-name" >  IxD Processes and Implementation    

The Interaction Design (IxD) processes have been key in shaping the website's design and functionality. Design decisions are documented with detailed annotations, outlining the rationale behind specific choices under this section. I believe I've made significant improvements to the initial wireframe designs, which were more artsy and visually appealing rather than actually diving into the process of Semantic markup and navigation and everything I’ve learnt now. I still like how it looks though, and I’m going to see about creating a similar vision with my CSS section, but for now, my wireframes feel way more intuitive in terms of navigation and consistent styling across pages.
 </section>
            <section>
<h4>Key design enhancements driven by the IxD processes include:
</h4>
<ul><li>Improved Navigation: Revisions to the site's navigation, aligning with Hick's Law, have reduced cognitive load and streamlined information access for users. – Essentially I've given stuff more of a hierarchical and spaced design to allow the viewers to navigate the pages easier, including a header and footer with key information
</li><li>Enhanced Readability: The implementation of Gestalt principles, including increased whitespace and clear visual hierarchies, has significantly improved content readability and comprehension. – I have my Headings and Subheadings differentiated
</li><li>Mobile Optimisation: I’ve tried  leveraging the constraints and affordances of the mobile screen, the mobile platform layout has been optimized for both visual appeal and efficient user interaction. – I’m hoping that my mobile versions are good enough and its okay for a basic understanding now
</li></ul>

 <p class="p-name" >  Style Guide and Design Choices :    

<h4>Inspiration: Marvel Rivals, Artistic Vibe, and a Clean Comic Book Aesthetic
</h4>
<p>My vision for this website is fueled by a love for artistic expression and a desire to create something visually striking. I'm particularly drawn to the artistic vibe and dynamic presentation seen in games like Marvel Rivals. I'm captivated by the way they bring comic book aesthetics to life in a highly engaging way, and that's a feeling I want to capture in my own work.
</p>
<p>However, instead of a direct adaptation, I'm aiming for a "cleaned up" comic book feel. Imagine the bold lines, vibrant colors, and dynamic layouts of a comic book, but with a modern, minimalist twist. This means prioritizing readability, intuitive navigation, and a refined visual hierarchy. The goal is to capture the essence of comic book storytelling without overwhelming the user with excessive visual clutter.
</p>
</section>
 
<section>
<p>To further clarify my vision, I've been studying portfolio websites like  
  <a href="https://www.alexfisherdesign.ca" class="brand-link"

 <p class="p-name" >  Alex Fisher's Design: A Clean and Focused Portfolio (with Inspiration for Comic Book Flair!)
    
</section>
            <section>
<p>Alex Fisher's portfolio website presents a clean and focused showcase of their graphic design and illustration work. Here's a breakdown of key observations:
</p>
<ul><li>Clear Value Proposition: The site immediately establishes Alex Fisher as a freelance graphic designer and illustrator based in Winnipeg, Canada. This clarity helps potential clients quickly understand their expertise and location.
</li>
<li>Emphasis on Specialization: The site highlights Alex's primary focus areas: illustration, branding, and identity projects. This specialization allows visitors to quickly assess if their needs align with Alex's expertise.
</li>
<li>Concise Content: The website is free of unnecessary clutter. The text is minimal and to the point, allowing the visual work to take center stage.
</li>
<li>Portfolio Organization: The portfolio is neatly categorized, featuring examples of Logo & Identity work, Style Guides, Packaging, Editorial Illustrations, and even UI/UX design skills. This allows visitors to easily navigate to specific areas of interest.
</li>
<li>Direct Calls to Action: The site includes a clear and accessible contact form and email address, encouraging potential clients to reach out.
</li>
<li>Clean Aesthetic: The overall design is simple and professional. This allows the focus to remain on the quality of Alex Fisher's work.
</li></ul>

<section>
 <p class="p-name" >  Strengths from this website that could inspire a comic book-esque website:
    <ul>
<li><p>  Categorization:   The clear categorization of portfolio pieces could translate well into a comic book panel-like structure, showcasing different areas of expertise.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>  Minimalism:   The minimalist approach, avoiding unnecessary clutter, could be adopted to create a clean, modern take on comic book aesthetics. This aligns with my goal of a "cleaned up" look.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>    Strong Typography: The use of clean, legible typography is essential in both website design and comic books, ensuring readability and visual appeal.
</p></li></ul>
 
<p>    Areas to consider when adapting to a comic book style (where I can inject that artistic vibe!):
</p>
<ul><li>
<p>  Adding Visual Flair:   While Alex Fisher's site is clean, a comic book-inspired website needs bolder color palettes, dynamic layouts, and unique typography choices. This is where the artistic energy comes in!
</p></li><li>
<p>  Storytelling:   Consider how to weave a narrative into the portfolio presentation, similar to how comic books tell stories through visuals. My goal is to make browsing my portfolio feel like flipping through the pages of a comic.
</p></li><li>
<p>  Interactive Elements:   Explore opportunities to incorporate interactive elements that mimic the experience of reading a comic book (e.g., panel transitions, sound effects).
</p></li>
</ul>
<p></section>
   
  <section>
I'm excited to blend the best of both worlds, creating a website that is both visually engaging, user-friendly, and reflects my artistic passions. The challenge lies in finding that perfect balance between the clean professionalism of a portfolio and the dynamic energy of a comic book. Stay tuned to see how it all comes together!

 <p class="p-name" >  Reflections on the Design Process    

<p>My main challenge encountered during development was managing the GitHub workflow. My Initial attempts used a live server for real-time previews of my webpage, since GitHub takes quite a long time to process changes, but I found that this resulted in inconsistencies and conflicts on GitHub pages and my links wouldn’t work ☹ . Now I've focused my development process to a GitHub Pages only workflow, utilizing Visual Studio Code for local development and link verification. The only issue is now that it takes a long time for it to input the changes and see them deployed officially on pages which can make you a bit confused with the process, when you're actively trying to work out bugs. its just hard to ensure your webpage on GitHub Pages is correctly linked, and the best thing to do is to refresh the page multiple times even when the page is deployed.
</p>
 
 </section>
            <section>
<p>Despite the challenges, the development process has been highly rewarding. It’s fascinating seeing how my code and HTML work can turn into a proper running interactive website. I also really enjoyed seeing my file structure come and work correctly, everything makes sense and has its working order. My project management skills seem to be developing 😊).  I’m proud of how, within the barebones of the HTML, you can still easily navigate throughout my website, and access whichever section you'd like to go to, and all my images display correctly. I’m learning a lot with this course and enjoying it.  on the side I've also started working on a personal project and a Website for my Baking business
</p>

            <section>
<h4>Future development efforts that i will focus on:
</h4>
</section>
            <section>
<p><ul><li>Content Optimization: Streamlining existing content and consolidating pages where appropriate or introducing additional dropdown menus for improved navigation. I’d like to condense some sections or possibly make some of my pages easier to access. They already have a logical order, but maybe there is a way to make it even easier to get to specific pages
</li>
<li>Semantic HTML: I've been a bit lazy with my Blog posts and editing them, but I’m going to start incorporating semantic HTML elements (e.g., article, role>, nav) to improve search engine optimization (SEO) and overall website accessibility.
