    <h1>Week 1 - Blog Post 1: Starting My Interactive Media Course</h1>
    <h3>By Jordyn Van Aswegen</h3>

    <h2>My experience Setting up Github and Publiching to Pages:</h2>
    <p>
      Setting up GitHub and publishing to Pages turned out to be much smoother
      than I expected, thanks to Hanli's helpful Ulwazi screenshots. Initially,
      I was hesitant GitHub has a reputation for being tricky, especially when
      user errors come into play. My past experiences haven’t been the best,
      often plagued by merge conflicts and issues in opening scenes. However,
      this time feels different, maybe because we’re working more independently.
      While that’s exciting, it also means that if something goes wrong, it’s
      entirely on me which is both thrilling and a little intimidating. By the
      end of this course, I hope to become a GitHub master, but only time will
      tell!
    </p>

    <p>
      Side Note??? It took me forever to figure out how to format this page so
      it doenst look like a complete lunatic decided to just paste words on a
      document and call it a day , wow thank you internet, and looking at other
      peoples pages , lol. You can see by the previous versions what i was doing
      with the different heading sizes... next we shall figure out colour and
      fonts :)) ... MWAHAHAHHA

    <h3>Reflections on the Readings & the Internet Today:</h3>

    <p>
      Exploring the history and evolution of the internet through these readings
      has been fascinating:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>"As We May Think" – Vannevar Bush</li>
      <li>"The Library of Babel" – Jorge Luis Borges</li>
      <li>"Flash and Its History on the Web"</li>
      <li>"The Dotcom Bubble of the 2000s"</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Library of Babel:</h3>

    <p>
      In The Library of Babel, Borges presents the concept of an infinite
      library that contains every possible book, with every possible combination
      of letters, words, and punctuation. This means that within its endless
      shelves, one could find every book ever written, every book that could
      ever be written, and countless variations filled with slight differences.
      However, many of these books are pure gibberish, making it nearly
      impossible to find anything truly meaningful. This reflects the struggle
      of navigating overwhelming amounts of information, much like what we
      experience with the internet today.
    </p>

    <p>
      The library represents both infinite knowledge and chaos, raising the
      question of whether ultimate truth is even attainable. Some inhabitants
      believe that somewhere within the endless volumes, there must exist a
      perfect book that explains everything—even the secrets of the universe.
      But with the infinite nature of the library, the search for such a book is
      nearly hopeless. This mirrors the real-world challenge of distinguishing
      valuable information from meaningless noise.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Library of Babel can also be seen as a metaphor for the Internet,
      where vast amounts of data are accessible, but not all of it is reliable
      or useful. Just as the library’s inhabitants must carefully sift through
      endless texts in search of meaning, modern internet users must critically
      evaluate information to find what is accurate and relevant. This idea
      extends beyond just information overload—it questions whether human
      knowledge is ever truly complete or if we are doomed to search endlessly
      without fully understanding everything. In the end, Borges suggests that
      true wisdom does not come from simply having access to infinite knowledge,
      but from knowing how to interpret and use it.
    </p>

    <h3>As We May Think:</h3>

    <p>
      Vannevar Bush’s As We May Think remains relevant even after 65 years,
      shaping the foundation of hypertext, information organization, and
      ultimately, the internet. His vision of the “MEMEX” a device designed to
      store and retrieve information based on associative trails rather than
      rigid hierarchical structures was a precursor to the World Wide Web.
      However, while the internet embodies many of Bush’s ideas, it also
      highlights their limitations.
    </p>

    <p>
      MEMEX concept emphasized human cognition, suggesting that information
      should be retrieved in a way that mimics how we think through connections
      and associations rather than fixed categories. This principle is at the
      heart of the internet, yet paradoxically, we often struggle to find the
      information we need despite its vastness. The sheer volume of data
      available can lead to endless searching without reaching the answers we
      seek, revealing a gap between accessibility and understanding.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bush believed that structuring knowledge based on association would
      enhance comprehension, but the internet has also exposed how fragmented
      and overwhelming information consumption can be. We are constantly
      navigating an ocean of data, yet we will never truly know everything, no
      matter how open access the web appears to be. This raises a deeper
      question not just about how information is stored and retrieved, but how
      we consume knowledge itself. In a world where endless information is at
      our fingertips, are we truly learning, or are we simply accumulating
      disconnected fragments?
    </p>

    <p>
      Bush’s work pushes us to reconsider not just how we organize information,
      but how we interact with it, reminding us that understanding is not just
      about access it’s about making meaningful connections.
    </p>

    <p>
      From this, I also wanted to consider how a smartphone would be in
      comparison to a MEMEX, and I found that the concept of the MEMEX and the
      modern-day cell phone share striking similarities in their roles as
      extensions of human memory and knowledge access, yet they diverge in
      execution and impact. Bush envisioned the MEMEX as a device that would
      allow users to store, retrieve, and link information through associative
      trails, much like the way the human mind works. Today’s smartphones
      function similarly, offering instant access to vast amounts of data,
      personalized knowledge organization, and interconnected media.
    </p>

    <p>
      While the MEMEX was designed to enhance deep, structured thinking by
      mimicking human cognition, smartphones often promote fragmented,
      algorithm-driven consumption, where information is curated for engagement
      rather than genuine comprehension. When we become too reliant on these
      algorithms, we risk being exposed only to content that aligns with our
      existing interests and beliefs, reinforcing biases rather than challenging
      them. Unlike the MEMEX, which encouraged user-created pathways of
      knowledge, smartphones depend heavily on external influences social media
      algorithms, search engine rankings, and targeted content that shape what
      we see, further narrowing our perspectives and limiting the breadth of
      knowledge we can access. In this way, while both devices function as tools
      for information, the MEMEX was designed to deepen understanding, whereas
      modern smartphones can overwhelm users with disconnected information,
      subtly shaping not just what we learn, but how we think.
    </p>

    <h3>Flash and its History on the Web:</h3>

    <p>
      The main thing I learned from this article and a bit of further research
      into Flash is that it was more than just a piece of software; it was a
      revolutionary force that shaped internet culture, fuelled creativity and
      defined an era of web animation and interactivity. Flash’s history, from
      humble beginnings as FutureSplash to becoming the backbone of early online
      games, animations, and even video streaming, is a testament to its
      influence. The rise of HTML5 and the mobile revolution may have sealed its
      fate, but the loss of Flash feels like the loss of an entire creative era
      a digital playground where ideas ran wild, unbound by rigid frameworks. It
      saddens me to know that so much content, so many groundbreaking
      experiments, and countless hours of creative labour are now lost to time,
      preserved only in scattered archives and fading memories. Flash’s legacy
      teaches us a valuable lesson: to challenge norms and innovate, but also to
      remain mindful of the fundamentals of the internet. It reminds us to
      create work that can be shared across multiple platforms, ensuring it’s
      not limited to a single ecosystem and can continue to thrive and evolve.
    </p>

    <h3>The Dotcom Bubble of the 2000s:</h3>

    <p>
      The Dot-Com Bubble was a period of intense excitement and speculation
      surrounding internet startups, many of which promised to revolutionize
      industries. These companies adopted a "Get Big Fast" approach, pouring
      excessive funds into marketing, branding, and customer acquisition, often
      selling products at a loss all while securing massive capital investments
      due to the overwhelming enthusiasm for internet-based businesses.
    </p>

    <p>
      One notable example was Priceline, a company founded in 1998 that allowed
      customers to name their own prices for airline tickets. The idea was
      simple: Priceline would sell unsold airline seats at discounted rates,
      benefiting both airlines (by filling empty seats) and customers (who paid
      lower prices). As a middleman, Priceline initially thrived. However, as
      its user base expanded, the company found itself operating at a
      loss—eventually having to pay full price for airline tickets while selling
      them at whatever the customer was willing to pay. While this strategy
      gained notoriety, it was ultimately unsustainable and led to significant
      financial losses.
    </p>

    <p>
      For many startups during the Dot-Com Bubble, sustainability was an
      afterthought. Some companies took pride in being unprofitable, as long as
      they had brand recognition, a large user base, and substantial capital
      investment. However, in 2001, the bubble burst due to irrational
      valuations, over-speculation, unsustainable business models, and rising
      interest rates.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Irrational Valuations: Investors prioritized rapid growth over
        profitability, leading to startups being valued in the billions despite
        heavy financial losses.
      </li>
      <li>
        Over-Speculation & Unsustainability: The stock market could not support
        so many unprofitable businesses, making it impossible for all of them to
        survive.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rising Interest Rates: In 1999–2000, the Federal Reserve tightened
        monetary policy, making credit and borrowing more expensive. With
        funding harder to secure, many startups collapsed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Despite its economic downturns, the Dot-Com Bubble played a crucial role
        in shaping the modern Internet. It paved the way for today’s digital
        economy, encouraging entrepreneurship and laying the foundation for
        critical infrastructure such as data centres, broadband networks, and
        e-commerce platforms.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Many survivors of the bubble, like Amazon, Google, and eBay, learned
      valuable lessons, shifting their focus toward sustainability and
      profitability. While the bubble may have burst, its impact set the stage
      for the internet to become a global economic force, driving both
      technology and international business forward.
    </p>

    <p>
      Looking at the development of the internet through these texts made me
      realize just how much our relationship with technology has changed. The
      web has evolved from an experimental concept to an essential part of
      everyday life, shaping how we communicate, work, and create.
    </p>

    <h3>Interesting Insights on the History of the Web:</h3>

    <p>
      The timeline of the web, spanning from 1988 to 2017, really put things
      into perspective. In just a few decades, we’ve gone from barely imagining
      the internet’s potential to customizing it to our every preference. And
      considering we’re now eight years beyond that timeline, the advancements
      in web technologies have only accelerated.
    </p>

    <p>
      One thing that stood out to me was r/Place. I had encountered it before
      but didn’t realize it started in 2017. Being part of some of the artworks
      on it was an incredible experience, so learning that the Reddit community
      shut down in 2023 was disappointing. Hopefully, it makes a comeback with
      the same energy and creativity. The mechanics of r/Place are pretty
      interesting, you can only place a single pixel every five minutes, and the
      canvas is limited to 4 million pixels. It’s a chaotic yet beautiful
      experiment in collaboration, where community input constantly reshapes the
      artwork. What’s even cooler is how the colour palette expanded over time,
      from just 16 colours in the beginning to 32 in 2023. It’s a great example
      of how online communities can create something incredible together.
    </p>

    />
    <p>
      Another point that caught my attention was how, in the early days of the
      web, skilled developers were scarce. Companies struggled to find people
      with the expertise to build websites. Today, web development is
      everywhere, and we have no shortage of skilled professionals. But now, a
      new challenge has emerged—the rise of AI in development. Many tasks that
      once required human expertise are now automated, and while AI simplifies
      the process, it also means fewer people are actively learning and
      practising these skills. The value of hands-on coding and development is
      shifting, and we’re at a crossroads where AI is reshaping not just how we
      build websites, but also how we define expertise in the field.
    </p>

    <h3>My Goals for This Course:</h3>

    <p>
      My main goal is to sharpen my coding skills and build a portfolio website
      that truly reflects my personal style and aesthetics (The Vibes). I’m
      particularly excited about working with HTML and JavaScript, as these
      skills will open new opportunities for me, I've been quite interested in
      Web Development since high school, so when I saw this when applying for
      University I was intrigued. Additionally, I want to refine my design
      abilities, although I have been working with design since I was 15, around
      6 years now. I'm hoping to deepen my skills and ensure that I not only
      understand best practices but can also execute them in final compositions.
      By the end of this course, I hope to have a well-designed, functional
      website and a deeper understanding of interactive media.
