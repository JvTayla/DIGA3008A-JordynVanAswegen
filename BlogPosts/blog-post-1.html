        <p>
          Setting up GitHub and publishing to Pages turned out to be much
          smoother than I expected, thanks to Hanli's helpful Ulwazi
          screenshots. Initially, I was hesitant—GitHub has a reputation for
          being tricky, especially when user errors come into play. My past
          experiences haven’t been the best, often plagued by merge conflicts
          and issues in opening scenes. However, this time feels different,
          maybe because we’re working more independently. While that’s exciting,
          it also means that if something goes wrong, it’s entirely on me—which
          is both thrilling and a little intimidating. By the end of this
          course, I hope to become a GitHub master, but only time will tell!

          Side note??? It took me forever to figure out how to format this page
          so it doesn’t look like a complete lunatic decided to just paste words
          on a document and call it a day. Wow thank you internet, and looking
          at other people’s pages, lol. You can see by the previous versions
          what I was doing with the different heading sizes... next we shall
          figure out colour and fonts... MWAHAHAHHA

         <p class="p-name" ><strong>Reflections on the Readings & the Internet Today:</strong><br>
    <div class="space"></div>
        <p>
          Exploring the history and evolution of the internet through these
          readings has been fascinating:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>"As We May Think" – Vannevar Bush</li>
          <li>"The Library of Babel" – Jorge Luis Borges</li>
          <li>"Flash and Its History on the Web"</li>
          <li>"The Dotcom Bubble of the 2000s"</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
   <div class="space"></div> 
      <section>
         <p class="p-name" ><strong>The Library of Babel:</strong><br>
    <div class="space"></div>
        <p>
          In *The Library of Babel*, Borges presents the concept of an infinite
          library that contains every possible book, with every possible
          combination of letters, words, and punctuation. This means that within
          its endless shelves, one could find every book ever written, every
          book that could ever be written, and countless variations filled with
          slight differences. However, many of these books are pure gibberish,
          making it nearly impossible to find anything truly meaningful. This
          reflects the struggle of navigating overwhelming amounts of
          information, much like what we experience with the internet today.
        </p>
    <div class="space"></div>
        <p>
          The library represents both infinite knowledge and chaos, raising the
          question of whether ultimate truth is even attainable. Some
          inhabitants believe that somewhere within the endless volumes, there
          must exist a perfect book that explains everything... even the secrets
          of the universe. But with the infinite nature of the library, the
          search for such a book is nearly hopeless. This mirrors the real-world
          challenge of distinguishing valuable information from meaningless
          noise.
        </p>
    <div class="space"></div>
        <p>
          *The Library of Babel* can also be seen as a metaphor for the internet,
          where vast amounts of data are accessible, but not all of it is
          reliable or useful. Just as the library’s inhabitants must carefully
          sift through endless texts in search of meaning, modern internet users
          must critically evaluate information to find what is accurate and
          relevant. This idea extends beyond just information overload—it
          questions whether human knowledge is ever truly complete or if we are
          doomed to search endlessly without fully understanding everything. In
          the end, Borges suggests that true wisdom does not come from simply
          having access to infinite knowledge, but from knowing how to interpret
          and use it.

         <p class="p-name" ><strong>As We May Think:</strong><br>
    <div class="space"></div>
        <p>
          Vannevar Bush’s *As We May Think* remains relevant even after 65 years,
          shaping the foundation of hypertext, information organisation, and
          ultimately, the internet. His vision of the “MEMEX”—a device designed
          to store and retrieve information based on associative trails rather
          than rigid hierarchical structures—was a precursor to the World Wide
          Web. However, while the internet embodies many of Bush’s ideas, it
          also highlights their limitations.
        </p>
    <div class="space"></div>
        <p>
          The MEMEX concept emphasised human cognition, suggesting that
          information should be retrieved in a way that mimics how we think
          through connections and associations rather than fixed categories.
          This principle is at the heart of the internet, yet paradoxically, we
          often struggle to find the information we need despite its vastness.
          The sheer volume of data available can lead to endless searching
          without reaching the answers we seek, revealing a gap between
          accessibility and understanding.
        </p>
    <div class="space"></div>
        <p>
          Bush believed that structuring knowledge based on association would
          enhance comprehension, but the internet has also exposed how
          fragmented and overwhelming information consumption can be. We are
          constantly navigating an ocean of data, yet we will never truly know
          everything, no matter how open access the web appears to be. This
          raises a deeper question—not just about how information is stored and
          retrieved, but how we consume knowledge itself. In a world where
          endless information is at our fingertips, are we truly learning, or
          are we simply accumulating disconnected fragments?
        </p>
    <div class="space"></div>
        <p>
          Bush’s work pushes us to reconsider not just how we organise
          information, but how we interact with it, reminding us that
          understanding is not just about access—it’s about making meaningful
          connections.
        </p>
    <div class="space"></div>
        <p>
          From this, I also wanted to consider how a smartphone would be in
          comparison to a MEMEX, and I found that the concept of the MEMEX and
          the modern-day cellphone share striking similarities in their roles
          as extensions of human memory and knowledge access, yet they diverge
          in execution and impact. Bush envisioned the MEMEX as a device that
          would allow users to store, retrieve, and link information through
          associative trails, much like the way the human mind works. Today’s
          smartphones function similarly, offering instant access to vast
          amounts of data, personalised knowledge organisation, and
          interconnected media.
        </p>
    <div class="space"></div>
        <p>
          While the MEMEX was designed to enhance deep, structured thinking by
          mimicking human cognition, smartphones often promote fragmented,
          algorithm-driven consumption, where information is curated for
          engagement rather than genuine comprehension. When we become too
          reliant on these algorithms, we risk being exposed only to content
          that aligns with our existing interests and beliefs, reinforcing
          biases rather than challenging them. Unlike the MEMEX, which
          encouraged user-created pathways of knowledge, smartphones depend
          heavily on external influences—social media algorithms, search engine
          rankings, and targeted content—that shape what we see, further
          narrowing our perspectives and limiting the breadth of knowledge we
          can access. In this way, while both devices function as tools for
          information, the MEMEX was designed to deepen understanding, whereas
          modern smartphones can overwhelm users with disconnected information,
          subtly shaping not just what we learn, but how we think.

         <p class="p-name" ><strong>Flash and its History on the Web:</strong><br>
    <div class="space"></div>
        <p>
          The main thing I learned from this article and a bit of further
          research into Flash is that it was more than just a piece of software;
          it was a revolutionary force that shaped internet culture, fuelled
          creativity, and defined an era of web animation and interactivity.
          Flash’s history, from humble beginnings as FutureSplash to becoming
          the backbone of early online games, animations, and even video
          streaming, is a testament to its influence. The rise of HTML5 and the
          mobile revolution may have sealed its fate, but the loss of Flash
          feels like the loss of an entire creative era—a digital playground
          where ideas ran wild, unbound by rigid frameworks. It saddens me to
          know that so much content, so many groundbreaking experiments, and
          countless hours of creative labour are now lost to time, preserved
          only in scattered archives and fading memories. Flash’s legacy teaches
          us a valuable lesson: to challenge norms and innovate, but also to
          remain mindful of the fundamentals of the internet. It reminds us to
          create work that can be shared across multiple platforms, ensuring
          it’s not limited to a single ecosystem and can continue to thrive and
          evolve.

         <p class="p-name" ><strong>The Dotcom Bubble of the 2000s:</strong><br>
    <div class="space"></div>
        <p>
          The Dot-Com Bubble was a period of intense excitement and speculation
          surrounding internet startups, many of which promised to revolutionise
          industries. These companies adopted a "Get Big Fast" approach, pouring
          excessive funds into marketing, branding, and customer acquisition,
          often selling products at a loss—all while securing massive capital
          investments due to the overwhelming enthusiasm for internet-based
          businesses.
        </p>
    <div class="space"></div>
        <p>
          One notable example was Priceline, a company founded in 1998 that
          allowed customers to name their own prices for airline tickets. The
          idea was simple: Priceline would sell unsold airline seats at
          discounted rates, benefiting both airlines (by filling empty seats)
          and customers (who paid lower prices). As a middleman, Priceline
          initially thrived. However, as its user base expanded, the company
          found itself operating at a loss—eventually having to pay full price
          for airline tickets while selling them at whatever the customer was
          willing to pay. While this strategy gained notoriety, it was
          ultimately unsustainable and led to significant financial losses.
        </p>
    <div class="space"></div>
        <p>
          For many startups during the Dot-Com Bubble, sustainability was an
          afterthought. Some companies took pride in being unprofitable, seeing
          it as proof that they were investing in future growth. However, once
          investor confidence dropped, the bubble burst—leaving behind bankrupt
          businesses and billions in losses. The Dot-Com Bubble stands as a
          cautionary tale about tech optimism and the importance of building
          sustainable models, not just flashy promises.

      <p>
        Another point that caught my attention was how, in the early days of
        the web, skilled developers were scarce. Companies struggled to find
        people with the expertise to build websites. Today, web development is
        everywhere, and we have no shortage of skilled professionals. But now,
        a new challenge has emerged—the rise of AI in development. Many tasks
        that once required human expertise are now automated, and while AI
        simplifies the process, it also means fewer people are actively
        learning and practising these skills. The value of hands-on coding and
        development is shifting, and we’re at a crossroads where AI is
        reshaping not just how we build websites, but also how we define
        expertise in the field.

       <p class="p-name" ><strong>My Goals for This Course</strong><br>
      <p>
        My main goal is to sharpen my coding skills and build a portfolio
        website that truly reflects my personal style and aesthetics (The
        Vibes). I’m particularly excited about working with HTML and
        JavaScript, as these skills will open new opportunities for me. I've
        been quite interested in web development since high school, so when I
        saw this when applying for university, I was intrigued. Additionally, I
        want to refine my design abilities, although I have been working with
        design since I was 15—around 6 years now. I'm hoping to deepen my
        skills and ensure that I not only understand best practices but can
        also execute them in final compositions. By the end of this course, I
        hope to have a well-designed, functional website and a deeper
        understanding of interactive media.
