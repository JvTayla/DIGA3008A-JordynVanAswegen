     <p class="intext-title">User Alignment<p>

    <p>User alignment in web design involves understanding and addressing the needs, behaviors, and preferences of one’s target audience. This essentially means you need to decide which users are your target audience and then cater your website towards their needs, so for example an employer would like to see your website, they would be interested in your recent projects you’ve worked on, as well as industry elements you’ve worked on, lets say you were being looked at for your writing skills, they would be more drawn to your Writing or blogs, or as a game developer, they would be interested in your prototypes and your GitHub / itch profiles, so it’s mostly about showing these people what they would like to see about you and you as the designer needs to guide them to these things or make them easily accessible :)
    </p>
  </section> 
    <section>
    <p>For my website design, I've focused on:
       
    <ul>
      <h4>Identifying my target audience:
       </h4>
       My target Audience is employers and potential clients for my artwork, I’d also like to use this website as a basic portfolio to keep my updated work on
        
       <h4>Understanding my target audiences’ goals:
       </h4>
       <p> So I believe that potential employers would like to see my about me section, my contact details and my work. To highlight this, I've made my portfolio one of my Navigation bars so it's easily accessible as well as my Contact me, and bout sections being easy to access. I've also decided to use the background as a way to show my recent environmental art designs that I’m working on, and to add to that comic book artistic feel.  Being able to easily explore my portfolio, learn about my artistic process, and contact me for inquiries.
       </p>
        
       <h4>Addressing my target audience's needs:
       </h4>
       <p>Here I asked myself, what would an employer want to see on my website, and what would they need to do this? I concluded that they would need me to Provide clear navigation, showcasing my work effectively, and offering easy contact options, they would also need access to my other work , which they can navigate easier with drop down menus and pages hyperlinked to other pages , so on my 2D Animation they can directly click to my 3D animation page. Or on my Traditional art page they also have the option to find subcategories, such as Line art, Acrylic paintings, Gouache paintings and stuff :0
       </p>
        
       <h4>Site Mapping</h4>

        </ul></p>
       </section>
    
    
        
  
<section>
    <p class="p-name" ><strong>Content</strong><br>
    
    <p>My website's content is structured as follows:
    
    <ul>Home Page: My home page is the front of my website, which I’m going to include a small about me section, a link to my latest Prototypes, artworks and animations, to gain interest and allow users to click on what they would like more information about :))
    About Page:  My about page is just about me and myself. My journey and where I studied and hobbies, and stuff
    Portfolio Pages: I have 3 main sections to showcase my different talents and work:
    Animation
    2D Animation
    3D Animation
    Game Development
    Prototypes
    Art
    Traditional Art
    Digital Art
    Blog Posts: Regular updates from my Blogs and my IM experience
    Essays: This page directs you to my essays I've written for IM, but since we haven’t done any essays yet, I've added a joke about coding
    Contact Page: My contact page has links to all my public social media, my LinkedIn profile, my itch.io, my Art Instagram  and my email address
  </ul> </p>

   <h4>My User Experience
    </h4>
    <p>The user experience is designed to be intuitive and engaging, for this I wanted to highlight my artistic ability, I'd like them to possibly feel like they're in a comic book? But I'm not sure how I would make that happen, but my goals are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clear navigation menu for easy access to all sections
    </li>
    <li>Consistent layout across pages for familiarity
    </li>
    <li>Responsive design for optimal viewing on all devices
    </li>
    <li> Visual hierarchy to guide users through content
    </li>
    <li>Section division so users can find specific things they may be looking for
    </li>
  </ul>
    <p class="p-name" ><strong>Interface Elements</strong><br>
     
   <h4> Key interface elements include:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
         Navigation bar with dropdown menus for portfolio categories- this allows easy navigation and accessibility
      </li> 
      <li>
        Image galleries with lightbox functionality for detailed viewing of my different artworks- so essentially when you click on an artwork it will give you more information like when I created it, the vision and the mediums
      </li>
      <li>
        Contact form for easy communication, this allows users to contact me with their messages and give me a grasp of what they might want to speak about.
      </li> 
      <li>
        Social media icons for additional engagement, since I’m using indexical and iconic signs, it makes it easier for users to visually grasp what they're for, plus we see these things on websites, and we know that clicking on it will redirect us to these specific icons :D
      </li>
      <li>
        I’m also thinking about adding a Search bar? but I don’t think it's particularly  necessary due to my navigation elements
      </li>
       
      <h4>Reflection on Structure, URL Scheme, and Semantic Markup
    </h4></ul>
   
    <p>The exercise of mapping out my site's content, experience, and interface elements has reinforced the importance of a logical structure and clear URL scheme. Each main section of my site (e.g., portfolio, blog) has its directory, with individual pages nested within.
    </section>
    <section>
    This structure is reflected in the URL scheme (e.g., /Portfolio/animation/3d), making it intuitive for users and search engines to understand the site's organization
    I updated my URL scheme and folder structure : 
    </p>
    Here's the planned URL and folder structure for my portfolio:
    <ul>
      <li>
    Home → /index.html</li>
    <li>Portfolio → /Portfolio/index.html</li>
    <li>Game Development → /Portfolio/game-dev/index.html</li>
    <li>Prototypes → /Portfolio/game-dev/prototypes.html</li>
    <li>Art → /Portfolio/art/index.html</li>
    <li>Traditional Art → /Portfolio/art/traditional-art.html</li>
    <li>Digital Art → /Portfolio/art/digital-art.html</li>
    <li>Animation → /Portfolio/animation/index.html</li>
    <li>3D Animation → /Portfolio/animation/3D.html</li>
    <li>2D Animation → /Portfolio/animation/2D.html</li>
    <li>Blog Posts→ /BlogPosts/index.html</li>
    <li>About Me → /Pages/about.html</li>
    <li>Contact →/Pages/contact.html</li>
  </ul>
</section>

   <p> Semantic markup refers to the use of HTML elements that convey the meaning and structure of content, rather than focusing on how it looks. It helps both browsers and users (including assistive technologies) understand the purpose of each element on a webpage. For example, using header for the top section, nav for navigation links, and article for main content provides clear context about the role of each section.
    </p>
    <p>In designing my website, I plan to leverage the header elements to create a seamless navigation experience. The concept involves using these semantic elements to house primary and secondary navigation menus, respectively.
    </p>
     
    <h4>Header Navigation Concept</h4>
    
    <p>The header will serve as the main navigation hub, featuring a prominent menu bar that links to key sections such as the portfolio, about page, and contact information. This strategic placement ensures that users can easily access these essential areas from any page on the site. The header's design will be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes to maintain usability across various devices.
    </p>
    <p>The alignment principles applied in my design, such as consistent positioning of navigation elements and content blocks, contribute to a cohesive user experience across all pages. This consistency helps users quickly understand how to interact with the site, regardless of which page they're on. I'll eventually format this correctly to be placed in the header, but this is how it looks so far:
    </p>
    <p>The clear structure and semantic markup further support this by making the site more accessible and easier to navigate for both humans and search engines.
    </p>
     
    <h4>Reflection on Development Progress for the Week
    </h4>
    <p>This week has been a significant turning point in my project's development. Initially, I wasn't satisfied with my previous wireframes, which led me to rework them entirely. The main goal was to create a more intuitive navigation system and enhance accessibility across the site. With a total of 15 pages, including an about page, contact page, home page, various portfolio sections, blog posts, and essays, I aimed to ensure that each page is easily accessible and contributes to a cohesive user experience.
    </p>
    <p>I'm much happier with the new direction, as it better highlights my artistic abilities and provides a clear structure for users to explore my work. Previously, I had only outlined four pages, but now I have a comprehensive idea of what I want my website to look like. This progress has been both challenging and rewarding, and I'm excited to continue refining my design to meet the needs of my users effectively.
    </p>
    <p>However, I encountered some technical challenges while hosting my project on GitHub Pages. While the site works perfectly on my local live server, with all links redirecting correctly and navigation functioning seamlessly, issues arise on GitHub Pages due to root folder configurations, that I’m not so sure how to fix.
    </p>
    <p>The main problem is that GitHub Pages expects the html files to be in the root directory, but my project structure relies on subfolders for organization. This has caused 404 errors when navigating between pages.
    </p>
    <p>Despite these challenges, I’m confident that I’ll resolve them soon, allowing my site to function as intended on GitHub Pages. These technical adjustments are a valuable learning experience, reinforcing my understanding of hosting and deployment workflow
    </p>
    <p>I also reworked my wireframe this week to better enhance my design goals and my navigation approach :
