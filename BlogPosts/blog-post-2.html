      Week 2 - Blog Post 2: Portfolio Structure, Inspiration, and Interaction on
      the Web
    </h1>
    <h3>By Jordyn Van Aswegen</h3>

    <h2>
      Reflection on Moulthrop, S. (2003) ‘You Say You Want a Revolution?
      Hypertext and the Laws of Media (1991)’
    </h2>

    <p>
      Stuart Moulthrop's "You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws
      of Media" examines the revolutionary potential of hypertext, questioning
      whether it has truly delivered on its promise. He connects hypertext to
      McLuhan's Laws of Media, exploring how it interacts with and transforms
      older media forms. Moulthrop notes early visions like Ted Nelson's Xanadu
      and contrasts them with the reality of a simplified, Web-based hypertext
      system. A key concern is whether hypertext's potential for dynamic,
      user-driven content has been overshadowed by corporate control and
      centralized access.
    </p>

    <h3>How it Speaks to the Internet Today</h3>

    <p>
      Moulthrop's critique remains relevant because the internet, while built on
      hypertext, has largely become dominated by corporate websites like Google
      and Meta, echoing his concerns about centralization. The "open and dynamic
      docuverse" envisioned for hypertext hasn't fully materialized. The
      internet's structure, despite hyperlinks, often leads to fragmented
      attention and echo chambers, rather than a truly free exchange of ideas.
      While users can "scribble in publicly-posted Web diaries," the primary
      mode of access is through controlled platforms. Even with the rise of
      "un-hypertext-like services" (instant messaging, games), the underlying
      tension between participatory ideals and corporate influence persists. The
      question remains: has the revolution come "full circle," or has it been
      co-opted by commercial interests?

    <h3>Why I Chose This Structure for My Portfolio</h3>

    <p>
      When thinking about how I wanted to organize my portfolio, I realized that
      just throwing everything into one section didn’t make sense. I’m working
      across multiple disciplines Game Development, Animation and Art and each
      of them is a big part of what I do. I want my portfolio to reflect that,
      making it easy for people to explore my work based on what they’re
      interested in.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead of having everything jumbled together, I decided to break my
      portfolio into clear categories:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Game Development</b> – Where I can showcase my prototypes and full
        game profiles.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Animation</b> – Since I’m working on both 2D and 3D animations, I
        need a place to show my progress and final pieces.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Art</b> – Because I’ve done both traditional and digital art, and I
        want a space to highlight both, as well as future 3D Blender Assets I
        want to create
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I also wanted a Blog section to share my thoughts, process, and university
      discussions. Since I’m triple majoring in Game Design, Graphic Design, and
      Interactive Media, I think I might be cool to also add a personal blog
      area to express my journey and what I've learnt, but that might only be a
      monthly thing or quarterly thing.
    </p>

    <h3>Why "Jetayla"?</h3>

    <p>
      I’ve been using Jetayla as my creative identity for a while now. My full
      name, Jordyn Van Aswegen, feels too long for a brand, and my surname is
      complicated. I thought about using just my first two names (Jordyn Tayla),
      but Jetayla feels cleaner, more unique, and honestly, more me.
    </p>

    <p>
      It’s also easier for people to remember and spell, which is important for
      a portfolio and personal brand. I want my work to be accessible, and
      having a name that stands out without being too complex helps with that.
    </p>

    <h3>What I Want to Showcase</h3>

    <p>
      This portfolio is my space to show off everything I’m passionate about.
      I’ve been doing a lot of traditional and digital art since high school,
      and I want to highlight how my skills have grown. I also have animations
      I’m going to be working on, both 2D and 3D, and I need a way to present
      them properly, I'm just not sure if I'd make it a link or upload the
      content directly onto the page (The animations wouldn’t be long).... Then
      there’s Game Development, which is a huge part of what I do. I’ve been
      making prototypes and building out game ideas, and I want a section that
      really showcases my process—from early concepts to playable builds and
      gives access to my Itch.io page.
    </p>

    <h2>Wireframe Concepts & Design Inspiration</h2>

    <p>
      A wireframe is a rough schematic created in the early stages of digital
      product design to help visualize and communicate the structure of a
      product or website.
    </p>

    <p>
      When it comes to designing my portfolio, I don’t just want it to be a
      standard, boring layout. I want it to be cool, creative, and full of
      personality something that represents my artistic style and the kind of
      work I do and my interests.
    </p>

    <p>Right now, I’m leaning toward two main stylistic directions:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>A Comic Book-Inspired Look</b> - Something dynamic, bold, and
        expressive, kind of like the Spider-Verse aesthetic. I love the mix of
        halftones, bold outlines, glitch effects, and high-contrast colours that
        make everything feel alive and full of energy. This would be perfect for
        showing off my game development work and digital art, giving the site an
        interactive and engaging feel.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>A Renaissance-Inspired Artistic Vibe</b> – A more painterly,
        textured, and expressive style, pulling from the dramatic lighting and
        storytelling of Renaissance art. This would make my traditional art,
        animations, and storytelling-focused work feel more immersive. Bright
        rich colours, brushstroke-like textures, and elegant typography to
        contrast the more modern elements.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Wireframe Concept</h3>

    <p>
      For the layout itself, I want the portfolio to feel fluid and engaging,
      not just a list of projects. Some initial ideas I have:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        A homepage that immediately grabs attention – Maybe an animated splash
        screen that introduces Jetayla in a really creative way, like a comic
        book panel opening up or a painterly transition effect.
      </li>
      <li>
        A portfolio grid that’s interactive – Instead of a simple list, I want
        hover effects, animated transitions, or even a parallax effect that
        makes browsing more engaging.
      </li>
      <li>
        A blog that feels like an artist’s journal – Instead of a traditional
        format, I want each blog post to feel like a comic book issue, with a
        cover-style thumbnail, bold titles, and maybe even speech bubbles and
        panel-like sections within the post.
      </li>
      <li>
        Navigation that fits the theme – If I go comic-style, I’d want speech
        bubble-like buttons, halftone textures, and maybe even animated “page
        turns.” If I go Renaissance, I’d use more elegant frames, brushstroke
        effects, and rich textures.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reflection on Interaction and the WWW</h2>

    <p>
      For me, interaction on the World Wide Web goes beyond simply clicking
      links and passively consuming information. True interaction involves a
      dynamic, reciprocal exchange between users, systems, and content. It's
      about agency, influence, and the ability to shape the online experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here's a breakdown of what interaction encompasses in the context of the
      WWW:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>User Agency</b>: Interaction means having genuine control over the
        online environment. It's about being able to actively search for
        information, customize settings, and contribute to the creation of
        content. A key aspect is the feeling of empowerment that comes from
        knowing you're not just a passive recipient.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Reciprocal Exchange</b>: Interaction isn't a one-way street. It
        involves giving as well as taking. This could mean providing feedback,
        leaving comments, participating in discussions, or collaborating on
        projects. The value of the interaction is enhanced when there's a sense
        of mutual benefit and shared purpose.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Meaningful Engagement</b>: Interaction should be more than just
        superficial activity. It should lead to deeper understanding, new
        insights, or personal growth. It should create a sense of connection
        with others and foster a sense of community.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Adaptability and Responsiveness</b>: An interactive system should be
        able to adapt to the user's needs and preferences. This means providing
        personalized recommendations, offering support when needed, and
        responding quickly to user input.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Creative Expression</b>: Interaction should provide opportunities for
        users to express themselves creatively. This could involve writing blog
        posts, creating videos, designing websites, or sharing artwork. The
        ability to create and share is a fundamental aspect of online
        interaction.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Ethical Considerations</b>: A crucial, often overlooked, aspect of
        interaction is its ethical dimension. Are the interactions designed to
        be manipulative or empowering? Does the system respect user privacy and
        autonomy? Ethical interaction prioritizes user well-being and promotes
        responsible online behavior.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In essence, interaction on the WWW, at its best, is a collaborative
      process that empowers individuals, fosters community, and promotes
      creativity and learning. It's about shaping the digital landscape
      together, rather than simply navigating it passively.
