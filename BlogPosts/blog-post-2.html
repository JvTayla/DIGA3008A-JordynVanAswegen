    <h3>Reflection on Moulthrop, S. (2003) ‘You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media (1991)’</h3>
    <p>
      Stuart Moulthrop's "You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media" examines the revolutionary potential of hypertext, questioning whether it has truly delivered on its promise. He connects hypertext to McLuhan's Laws of Media, exploring how it interacts with and transforms older media forms. Moulthrop notes early visions like Ted Nelson's Xanadu and contrasts them with the reality of a simplified, Web-based hypertext system. A key concern is whether hypertext's potential for dynamic, user-driven content has been overshadowed by corporate control and centralized access.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>How it Speaks to the Internet Today</h3>
    <p>
      Moulthrop's critique remains relevant because the internet, while built on hypertext, has largely become dominated by corporate websites like Google and Meta, echoing his concerns about centralization. The "open and dynamic docuverse" envisioned for hypertext hasn't fully materialized. The internet's structure, despite hyperlinks, often leads to fragmented attention and echo chambers, rather than a truly free exchange of ideas. While users can "scribble in publicly-posted Web diaries," the primary mode of access is through controlled platforms. Even with the rise of "un-hypertext-like services" (instant messaging, games), the underlying tension between participatory ideals and corporate influence persists. The question remains: has the revolution come "full circle," or has it been co-opted by commercial interests?

    <h3>Why I Chose This Structure for My Portfolio</h3>
    <p>
      When thinking about how I wanted to organize my portfolio, I realized that just throwing everything into one section didn’t make sense. I’m working across multiple disciplines—Game Development, Animation, and Art—and each of them is a big part of what I do. I want my portfolio to reflect that, making it easy for people to explore my work based on what they’re interested in.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead of having everything jumbled together, I decided to break my portfolio into clear categories:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Game Development</b> – Where I can showcase my prototypes and full game profiles.</li>
      <li><b>Animation</b> – Since I’m working on both 2D and 3D animations, I need a place to show my progress and final pieces.</li>
      <li><b>Art</b> – Because I’ve done both traditional and digital art, and I want a space to highlight both, as well as future 3D Blender Assets I want to create.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I also wanted a Blog section to share my thoughts, process, and university discussions. Since I’m triple majoring in Game Design, Graphic Design, and Interactive Media, I think I might be cool to also add a personal blog area to express my journey and what I've learned, but that might only be a monthly or quarterly thing.
    </p>
  </section>

    <h3>Why "Jetayla"?</h3>
    <p>
      I’ve been using Jetayla as my creative identity for a while now. My full name, Jordyn Van Aswegen, feels too long for a brand, and my surname is complicated. I thought about using just my first two names (Jordyn Tayla), but Jetayla feels cleaner, more unique, and honestly, more me.
    </p>

    <p>
      It’s also easier for people to remember and spell, which is important for a portfolio and personal brand. I want my work to be accessible, and having a name that stands out without being too complex helps with that.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>What I Want to Showcase</h3>
    <p>
      This portfolio is my space to show off everything I’m passionate about. I’ve been doing a lot of traditional and digital art since high school, and I want to highlight how my skills have grown. I also have animations I’m going to be working on, both 2D and 3D, and I need a way to present them properly, I'm just not sure if I'd make it a link or upload the content directly onto the page (The animations wouldn’t be long)... Then there’s Game Development, which is a huge part of what I do. I’ve been making prototypes and building out game ideas, and I want a section that really showcases my process—from early concepts to playable builds and gives access to my Itch.io page.
    </p>

    <h2>Wireframe Concepts & Design Inspiration</h2>
    <p>
      A wireframe is a rough schematic created in the early stages of digital product design to help visualize and communicate the structure of a product or website.
    </p>

    <p>
      When it comes to designing my portfolio, I don’t just want it to be a standard, boring layout. I want it to be cool, creative, and full of personality—something that represents my artistic style and the kind of work I do and my interests.
    </p>

    <p>Right now, I’m leaning toward two main stylistic directions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>A Comic Book-Inspired Look</b> – Something dynamic, bold, and expressive, kind of like the Spider-Verse aesthetic. I love the mix of halftones, bold outlines, glitch effects, and high-contrast colours that make everything feel alive and full of energy. This would be perfect for showing off my game development work and digital art, giving the site an interactive and engaging feel.</li>
      <li><b>A Renaissance-Inspired Artistic Vibe</b> – A more painterly, textured, and expressive style, pulling from the dramatic lighting and storytelling of Renaissance art. This would make my traditional art, animations, and storytelling-focused work feel more immersive. Bright rich colours, brushstroke-like textures, and elegant typography to contrast the more modern elements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Wireframe Concept</h3>
    <p>For the layout itself, I want the portfolio to feel fluid and engaging, not just a list of projects. Some initial ideas I have:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A homepage that immediately grabs attention – Maybe an animated splash screen that introduces Jetayla in a really creative way, like a comic book panel opening up or a painterly transition effect.</li>
      <li>A portfolio grid that’s interactive – Instead of a simple list, I want hover effects, animated transitions, or even a parallax effect that makes browsing more engaging.</li>
      <li>A blog that feels like an artist’s journal – Instead of a traditional format, I want each blog post to feel like a comic book issue, with a cover-style thumbnail, bold titles, and maybe even speech bubbles and panel-like sections within the post.</li>
      <li>Navigation that fits the theme – If I go comic-style, I’d want speech bubble-like buttons, halftone textures, and maybe even animated “page turns.” If I go Renaissance, I’d use more elegant frames, brushstroke effects, and rich textures.</li>
    </ul>

      <h2>Reflection on Interaction and the WWW</h2>

      <p>
        For me, interaction on the World Wide Web goes beyond simply clicking
        links and passively consuming information. True interaction involves a
        dynamic, reciprocal exchange between users, systems, and content. It's
        about agency, influence, and the ability to shape the online experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here's a breakdown of what interaction encompasses in the context of the
        WWW:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>User Agency</b>: Interaction means having genuine control over the
          online environment. It's about being able to actively search for
          information, customize settings, and contribute to the creation of
          content. A key aspect is the feeling of empowerment that comes from
          knowing you're not just a passive recipient.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Reciprocal Exchange</b>: Interaction isn't a one-way street. It
          involves giving as well as taking. This could mean providing feedback,
          leaving comments, participating in discussions, or collaborating on
          projects. The value of the interaction is enhanced when there's a
          sense of mutual benefit and shared purpose.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Meaningful Engagement</b>: Interaction should be more than just
          superficial activity. It should lead to deeper understanding, new
          insights, or personal growth. It should create a sense of connection
          with others and foster a sense of community.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Adaptability and Responsiveness</b>: An interactive system should
          be able to adapt to the user's needs and preferences. This means
          providing personalized recommendations, offering support when needed,
          and responding quickly to user input.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Creative Expression</b>: Interaction should provide opportunities
          for users to express themselves creatively. This could involve writing
          blog posts, creating videos, designing websites, or sharing artwork.
          The ability to create and share is a fundamental aspect of online
          interaction.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Ethical Considerations</b>: A crucial, often overlooked, aspect of
          interaction is its ethical dimension. Are the interactions designed to
          be manipulative or empowering? Does the system respect user privacy
          and autonomy? Ethical interaction prioritizes user well-being and
          promotes responsible online behavior.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In essence,. interaction on the WWW, at its best, is a collaborative
        process that empowers individuals, fosters community, and promotes
        creativity and learning. It's about shaping the digital landscape
        together, rather than simply navigating it passively.

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      My portfolio is still a work in progress, but I’ve got a clear idea of what I want to achieve. I want it to reflect both my technical skills and artistic voice. I’m excited to keep evolving it, making it not only functional but also a piece of creative work in itself. The wireframe concepts I’ve explored will guide me in making sure my portfolio is cohesive, engaging, and unique—true to my vision as a digital artist and designer.
