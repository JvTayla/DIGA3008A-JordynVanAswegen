             The internet, once celebrated for fostering community, accessibility, and global connectivity, has
              become a contested space where geopolitics, corporate interests, and digital coloniality 
              intersect. The dominance of a handful of technology giants, primarily headquartered in 
              the United States, has birthed a new form of coloniality. While not colonialism in the 
              traditional sense, this digital coloniality involves the economic and informational exploitation 
              of populations, particularly in the Global South, reminiscent of Cold War-era propaganda battles 
              (Graham, 2014; Ballatore, Graham & Sen, 2017).

          <section class="p-analysis">
            <p>
              This essay critically examines these intersections through the lens of Meta’s systematic 
              censorship of pro-Palestinian content during the 2023–2024 Gaza (ongoing) conflict. 
              Drawing on academic literature, news reports, social media activism, and theoretical 
              frameworks, this analysis situates Meta’s censorship within broader debates about digital sovereignty, 
              algorithmic power, and the persistence of colonial logics in the digital age. </p>
          </section>
<p class="subheading">Theoretical Foundations:</p>
          <section class="p-analysis">
            <p>
              Colonialism is defined as the policy or practice of acquiring full or partial political control 
              over another country, occupying it with settlers, and exploiting it economically (Oxford English Dictionary, 2024). 
              Digital coloniality extends these power relations into the digital realm, where data, infrastructure, 
              and platforms are controlled by a few corporations and countries primarily in the Global North 
              (Graham, 2014; Ballatore, Graham & Sen, 2017).    
            </p>
          </section>
          <section class="p-analysis">
            <p>
              The Global North & Global South divide broadly distinguishes developed regions (such as the USA,
               Europe, and parts of Asia) from developing regions (such as Africa and Latin America), 
              often reflecting historical patterns of wealth and power.  </p>
          </section>
          <section class="p-analysis">
            <p>
             Couldry and Mejias (2019) introduce the concept of “data colonialism,” drawing explicit parallels 
             with historical colonialism: “the appropriation of human life so that data can be continuously extracted 
             from it for profit.” Just as colonial regimes extracted land and resources, data colonialism commodifies 
             human life through relentless quantification. </p>
          </section>
          <section class="p-analysis">
            <p>
              Digital coloniality is not limited to infrastructure but extends to algorithms and moderation 
              policies that determine content visibility, amplify certain voices, and silence others. Graham and 
              Dittus (2020) argue that platforms such as Google Maps and Wikipedia, while serving as gateways to 
              knowledge, are rife with gaps and biases that reflect and reinforce processes of exclusion.

            <p>
              Algorithmic colonialism, as articulated by Shakir et al. (2020), is marked by domination 
              through invisible mechanisms, algorithms that perpetuate historical patterns of power and 
              marginalisation. Algorithmic oppression privileges certain social groups at the expense 
              of others, often encoding and perpetuating colonial biases through unrepresentative datasets.

          <p class="subheading">Geopolitics and the Digital Ecosystem:</p>
          <section class="p-analysis">
            <p>
              In the current digital era, geopolitics is defined not only by territorial disputes but 
              also by competition for control over digital spaces, standards, and narratives. The 
              rivalry between the United States and China over platforms such as TikTok and Huawei 
              exemplifies how digital geopolitics can fragment the global internet, with profound 
              implications for communication, trade, and governance (Nyabola, 2018).  
            </p>
          </section>
          <section class="p-analysis">
            <p>
              For the Global South, this means navigating a digital ecosystem where access, 
              representation, and agency are mediated and often restricted by actors far removed 
              from local realities. The dominance of Western tech companies in Africa and elsewhere 
              creates dependencies and power imbalances reminiscent of colonial rule (Nyabola, 2018).   
            </p> 
          </section>
          <section class="p-personal">
            <p>
             This imbalance is not just theoretical but deeply felt in everyday digital experiences. 
             For instance, my own social media feeds, such as the “For You” pages on Instagram and 
             TikTok, are overwhelmingly populated by American, European, or UK voices, even when I 
             am seeking content relevant to my local context. I frequently encounter content from 
             American bakers, influencers, and commentators, while African or South African 
             perspectives are comparatively scarce. When local or Global South issues do surface, 
             they are often misinterpreted or overshadowed by dominant Western narratives. A recent 
             example is the controversy surrounding Tyla and the term “Coloured”: in the US, the term 
             is seen as a racial slur, whereas in South Africa it denotes a distinct ethnic identity. 
             The global algorithmic privileging of Western perspectives often leads to 
             misunderstandings, erasure, and the imposition of foreign frameworks onto local realities. 
             This digital hierarchy not only shapes what stories are amplified but also who gets to 
             define the terms of debate, reinforcing a sense of cultural superiority and further 
             marginalising non-Western voices.

           <section class="p-case">
            <p>
              During the ongoing conflict in Gaza (from October 2023), Human Rights Watch (2023) and 
              other organisations documented widespread, systematic censorship of pro-Palestinian 
              content on Meta’s platforms, including Facebook and Instagram. According to a December 
              2023 HRW report, Meta’s moderation policies resulted in the removal, suppression, or 
              shadow-banning of over 1,000 instances of peaceful content supporting Palestinian rights 
              across 60 countries (Human Rights Watch, 2023; Mashable, 2023).

          <ul>
          <li>Removal of posts, stories, and comments raising awareness of the conflict</li>
          <li>Suspension or permanent disabling of accounts advocating for Palestinian rights</li>

             Meta denied allegations of deliberate, systematic suppression, attributing the incidents 
             to enforcement errors. However, the scale and consistency of the censorship, corroborated 
             by multiple civil society organisations, suggest otherwise (Human Rights Watch, 2023; 
             Mashable, 2023).   </p>

          <p class="subheading">Social Media Activism and Resistance:</p>
          <section class="p-activism">
            <p>
            Despite these constraints, activists and ordinary users developed creative strategies to 
            circumvent algorithmic censorship, such as employing alternative spellings, symbols 
            (e.g., watermelon emojis, coloured hearts, and the Palestinian flag), and coded language.

          </section>
          <section class="p-activism">
            <p>
           A particularly notable example of digital resistance is the work of the creator Yuval (@yuvaltheterrible). 
           Yuval employs innovative strategies to avoid algorithmic censorship on platforms like Instagram. 
           He often begins his videos with unrelated or deliberately controversial topics to attract 
           attention and engagement. Once viewers are invested, he shifts the discussion to issues 
           such as Palestinian war crimes, encouraging audience interaction through comments 
           related to the initial controversy. This approach helps his content avoid being flagged 
           as pro-Palestinian and thus suppressed by platform algorithms. Beyond raising awareness, 
           Yuval actively supports Palestinian families by fundraising to assist with relocation, 
           food, and medical needs.   
          </p>
          </section>
          <section class="p-activism">
            <p>
           Yuval has also collaborated with other creators, such as Ayame (@ayame.p) and Oliver (@olivermillsn), 
           to generate further engagement. For example, they constructed an ongoing narrative involving a fictional 
           love triangle, which captured audience interest and drove traffic to their fundraising campaigns. 
           The continuation of these storylines was linked to achieving specific fundraising goals, thereby 
           leveraging social media dynamics to support humanitarian efforts for Palestinian families.

           These acts of digital resistance underscore both the adaptability of marginalised communities and the 
           pervasive reach of digital coloniality, where even resistance must be negotiated within the constraints 
           imposed by distant corporate actors.

          <section class="p-issue">
          <p>
           Meta’s actions exemplify how digital coloniality operates at the intersection of corporate policy, 
           economic interests, and geopolitical power. Content moderation practices on platforms like Facebook 
           and Instagram are shaped not only by internal guidelines but also by external political 
           and financial pressures. These dynamics disproportionately marginalise voices from the 
           Global South and those critical of powerful allies, as seen in the systematic 
           silencing of pro-Palestinian content. This is not merely a technical or algorithmic 
           issue; it reflects broader power structures that privilege certain narratives while 
           excluding others (Ballatore, Graham & Sen, 2017). 
          </p>
          </section>
          <section class="p-issue">
          <p>
           As Ballatore et al. (2017) argue, search engines and social platforms do not simply 
           mirror reality; they actively construct it, privileging “localness” only when it aligns 
           with dominant commercial and political interests. In this context, Palestinian voices 
           become invisible on the global stage, reinforcing a digital status quo that mirrors 
           historical patterns of colonial erasure.
          </p>
          </section>
           <section class="p-issue">
          <p>
           The influence of corporate funding, sponsorship, and broader geopolitical alliances 
           further complicates the landscape. Major technology companies are deeply embedded in 
           global networks of investment and partnership, which can shape both overt and subtle 
           aspects of content moderation. Analysts have noted that these relationships often result 
           in the amplification of perspectives aligned with powerful stakeholders, while 
           alternative or oppositional voices, such as those supporting Palestinian rights, 
           are suppressed (Couldry & Mejias, 2019; Human Rights Watch, 2023).

          <p class="p-recommendation">
           It is important to recognise that while the backgrounds and beliefs of tech leaders 
           may contribute to corporate culture, it is primarily the intersection of economic, 
           political, and institutional factors that shapes platform policy. For example, 
           public reporting has highlighted how lobbying, regulatory pressures, and international 
           alliances can influence the moderation decisions of companies like Meta (Mashable, 2023). 
           This systemic gatekeeping perpetuates digital coloniality by maintaining existing power 
           imbalances and limiting the visibility of marginalised groups.

          In summary, algorithmic gatekeeping on global platforms is not a neutral process. 
          It is deeply entwined with historical and contemporary forms of power, shaping what 
          is seen, heard, and ultimately remembered in the digital age.

         The case of Meta’s censorship is not isolated. Similar patterns of digital erasure and 
         selective amplification have been observed globally, particularly in the suppression of 
         protest movements and humanitarian crises in the Global South. For example, the ongoing 
         conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide 
         have received minimal sustained attention in international media and on digital 
         platforms, despite the scale of violence and exploitation involved (Nzongola-Ntalaja, 2013; 
         Straus, 2006). The DRC continues to be exploited for its mineral resources, with little 
         global awareness or intervention, an invisibility perpetuated by both traditional and 
         digital media. This selective visibility raises urgent questions about digital sovereignty: 
         who controls the digital public sphere, and whose stories are legitimised or erased?

            As South Africans, it is crucial to amplify our voices on pressing political issues, 
            such as gender-based violence and the ongoing legacy of apartheid, which are also 
            subject to digital censorship. All communities deserve to be heard, understood, and

           As a South African, the historical legacy of apartheid profoundly shapes my understanding 
           of systemic oppression and censorship. Witnessing the ongoing conflict in Gaza, I am 
           struck by the parallels between the suppression of marginalised voices there and the 
           silencing tactics once employed under apartheid. Despite living in an era of 
           unprecedented digital connectivity, access to truthful, uncensored information remains 
           constrained. The suppression of content on media and social platforms perpetuates 
           ignorance and apathy, echoing the ways international silence once enabled apartheid 
           to persist. Just as global pressure and awareness eventually contributed to dismantling 
           that regime, today we must advocate for transparency, platform accountability, and 
           the amplification of voices facing injustice. Recognising these recurring patterns 
           is crucial in resisting both historical and digital forms of coloniality.

           The case of Meta’s censorship of pro-Palestinian content during the 2023–2024 
           Gaza conflict offers a powerful lens through which to understand the intersections 
           of the internet, geopolitics, and digital coloniality. While digital platforms have 
           promised openness and connection, they increasingly reproduce old hierarchies, 
           privileging dominant narratives while silencing marginalised voices, particularly from 
           the Global South. This is not accidental but rooted in systemic structures of economic 
           power, political influence, and algorithmic control that echo historical forms of 
           colonialism.

           As digital citizens, we must question who controls our information spaces and for 
           whose benefit. The struggle for digital justice is deeply connected to broader movements 
           for decolonisation and equity. In recognising the power dynamics embedded in our digital 
           lives, we can begin to advocate for more inclusive, accountable, and sovereign digital 
           futures, ones where all communities, including Palestinians, South Africans, and other 
           marginalised groups, have the right to speak, be heard, and shape the narratives that 
           define them.
