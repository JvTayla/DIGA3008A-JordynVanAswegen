        <p class="intext-title">Organizing My Folder Structure</p>
      </section>
      <section class="p-analysis">
        <p>One of the foundational steps in my website development process was establishing a clear and logical folder structure. Early on, I recognized how crucial it was to separate different types of files, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media assets like images, into dedicated folders. This separation helped me manage the growing complexity of my site and reflect the underlying hierarchy of its content. Structuring my project in this modular way wasn’t just about neatness, it improved efficiency, reduced confusion, and made it significantly easier to debug and update code.</p>
         <p>As the site expanded, the benefits of this approach became even more evident. Being able to locate files quickly and understand their purpose at a glance prevented errors and made collaborative editing easier. It also laid the groundwork for future scalability. Whether I’m adding a new feature or refactoring old code, I now understand that a well-organised folder structure is essential to long-term maintainability.</p>

      <section>
        <p class="intext-title">Using Semantic HTML Markup</p>
      </section>
      <section class="p-analysis">
        <p>Learning to implement semantic HTML has been one of the most transformative parts of my web development journey. By using elements such as < -header>, < -nav>, < -main>, < -section>, and < -footer>, I gave my pages a meaningful structure that benefits both users and machines. Semantic markup not only improves SEO and performance, but it also enhances accessibility for users who rely on screen readers or keyboard navigation.</p>
           <p>I paid close attention to using appropriate heading levels, labelling interactive elements clearly, and avoiding unnecessary <div> and <span> elements. This not only clarified the page layout for me as a developer but also improved the overall user experience. While I still have room for improvement, particularly in ensuring full accessibility, I’ve developed a deeper appreciation for semantic design. It’s not just a coding convention; it’s a tool for inclusive, user-centred design.</p>

      <section>
        <p class="intext-title">Improving Metadata for SEO and Accessibility</p>
      </section>
      <section class="p-analysis">
        <p>Metadata was something I initially overlooked, but came to see as a critical component of web development. While I did manage to include basic meta tags like descriptions, keywords, and author information on my blog and essay pages, I now realise the importance of applying this consistently across every page. I’ve learned that metadata plays a huge role in how content is displayed in search engine results and social media previews, and even affects how accessible a site is for all users.</p>
        <p>Moving forward, I plan to include more comprehensive metadata, from viewport settings for responsive design to Open Graph tags for better social media integration. I also want to explore the use of structured data to further enhance how search engines interpret my content. Metadata may seem like a small detail, but this journey has taught me that even minor elements can have a major impact.</p>  </section>

      <section>
        <p class="intext-title">CSS: Growing Through Challenges and New Practices</p>
      </section>
      <section class="p-analysis">
        <p>Styling my website with CSS was both one of the most creative and challenging parts of the process. At first, I kept all my styles in a single main stylesheet, which worked fine when the site was small. But as it grew and required more custom styles for different sections and pages, the file became increasingly cluttered and difficult to manage. I ran into issues where changes to one style unexpectedly affected others, and it became clear that my CSS lacked the structure needed for long-term scalability.</p> 
        <p>I attempted to restructure and rationalise my CSS during development, but I found that changes sometimes broke layouts or altered the carefully crafted visual feel of the site. As a result, I decided not to fully modularize the styles within this project. However, the experience taught me a valuable lesson: CSS needs to be planned with growth in mind from the very beginning.</p>
      <p>Since completing this project, I’ve started applying better CSS practices in my personal and current website designs, things like breaking styles into logical sections, using reusable utility classes, and applying a more component, based styling approach. Even though I didn’t get everything right the first time, I now understand how critical it is to write CSS that is scalable, maintainable, and easy to read. I’m committed to continuing this growth in future projects.</p>

      <section>
        <p class="intext-title">JavaScript: Bringing My Site to Life</p>
      </section>
      <section class="p-analysis">
      <p>JavaScript was where I could truly inject interactivity and personality into my site. From animated stars in the background to smooth page transitions and dynamic navigation buttons, I used JS to create engaging user experiences. I made a deliberate choice to keep my scripts in external files to maintain a clean HTML structure and encourage code reusability.</p>
      <p>As my codebase grew, I noticed repeated patterns, especially in navigation and form validation logic, which highlighted the importance of modular functions and DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles. I also began exploring asynchronous JavaScript (like fetch() and async/await) to enhance performance and responsiveness, particularly for form submissions and content loading.</p>  
      <p>While I still have more to learn in this area, especially in terms of performance optimization and scalability, JavaScript became a tool that allowed me to go beyond static design and build richer, more responsive experiences. This aspect of development was especially rewarding because it connected design with functionality in a way that felt powerful and creative.</p>

      <section>
        <p class="intext-title">Personal Growth and Lessons Learned</p>
      </section>
      <section class="p-personal">
        <p>This website was more than just a school project; it was a reflection of my creativity, technical progress, and evolving understanding of design principles. I was able to showcase my personality through visuals, colour schemes, layout choices, and interactive elements, all while applying the foundational skills I’ve learned in web development.</p>
        <p>Seeing how my classmates approached the same task with unique styles and solutions pushed me to go beyond surface-level design and make my site both functional and expressive. It became a space where I could experiment, make mistakes, and learn through doing.</p>
        <p>Looking back, the biggest lessons I’ve learned are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Planning ahead (especially folder structure and CSS strategy) saves time and stress later.</li>
          <li>Semantic HTML and accessibility matter ,they make the site usable for everyone.</li>
          <li>Modular design is key for scalability, across HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
          <li>Small details like metadata and headings have a big impact.</li>
          <li>It’s okay if everything isn’t perfect ,what matters is learning and improving.</li>
        </ul>
          </section>
          <section>><p>This journey has been both challenging and incredibly rewarding. I’m leaving this project with a stronger skill set, a clearer development process, and a deeper appreciation for the craft of building websites. (One of the coolest things is that I can understand what's going on in websites now!, and I can edit things I don’t like, e.g. if the CSS is too bright on the browsers ) Most importantly, I feel more confident and excited to continue learning, experimenting, and growing in this field. The skills I’ve gained here are just the beginning, and I can’t wait to see how they evolve in future projects.</p>
