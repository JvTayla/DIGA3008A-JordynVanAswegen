              Digital Exclusion by Design: An Ethical Analysis of the UI and UX in the South African Home Affairs Website
            </p>

          <section class="p-analysis">
            <p>
              South Africa’s constitutional promise of accessible government services is fundamentally tied to the Department of Home Affairs (DHA), whose website 
              <a class ="intext-link "href="https://www.dha.gov.za">https://www.dha.gov.za</a> serves as the primary digital gateway for millions of citizens. Yet, for many, especially those from rural or marginalised backgrounds, this portal is not a bridge but a barrier, riddled with design flaws that reinforce digital exclusion.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section class="p-analysis">
            <p>
              This essay critically examines how the DHA website’s design choices 
              unintentionally restrict access to vital services and information, 
              particularly for underprivileged groups. While UI (User Interface) 
              and UX (User Experience) are often seen as technical disciplines, 
              they also hold ethical weight in shaping who gets access and who is 
              left behind.

              Drawing on principles from accessibility guidelines, design justice 
              (Costanza-Chock, 2020), and UX best practices, this analysis identifies 
              areas of improvement and explores how design decisions can better serve 
              the full spectrum of South African citizens.

              The Department of Home Affairs (DHA) is a key part of the South African 
              government that handles essential services like issuing ID documents, 
              passports, and registering births, marriages, and deaths.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section class="p-analysis">
            <p>
              The DHA website is meant to make these services easy to access online. 
              Ideally, users should be able to find forms, understand procedures, and 
              even book appointments from the website, saving time and reducing the need 
              for in-person visits.

              However, the website has problems that make it hard for many people to 
              use, especially those with disabilities, older users, or people who are 
              not familiar with the internet.

          <p class="subheading">(UI) Visual Analysis: Clutter and Cognitive Overload :</p>
          <section class="p-analysis">
            <p>
              Addressing clutter and cognitive overload requires focusing on core design 
              principles such as visual hierarchy, contrast, alignment, proximity, and 
              consistency.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section class="p-case">
            <p>
              To better understand the problem, I analysed a screenshot of the DHA 
              homepage. The page is visually cluttered with numerous buttons, banners, 
              and announcements stacked on top of each other with inconsistent spacing.

              Good website design should reduce cognitive load by organising information 
              clearly and prioritising the most important tasks. Users visiting the DHA 
              website are likely looking to perform critical tasks like renewing an ID or 
              finding visa information. However, the layout does not guide the user toward 
              these actions in a clear or intuitive way.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section class="p-case">
            <p>
              Imagine a 16-year-old visiting the site to apply for an ID. Instead of being 
              guided to a clear CTA (Call to Action) button, they are met with dense 
              paragraphs of text, outdated design elements, and an overwhelming number of 
              navigation links. This violates key UX heuristics like “visibility of system 
              status” and “aesthetic and minimalist design.”

          <section  class="p-analysis">

              I tested the website using tools like the WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation 
              Tool and browser dev tools to simulate different screen sizes. Many key issues 
              emerged: improper alt text on images, poor colour contrast, and text that 
              doesn’t scale well for mobile or visually impaired users.

              In summary, the DHA website’s cluttered visuals make it difficult to navigate, 
              especially for users who are less tech-savvy or who rely on screen readers or 
              assistive tech. The UI lacks focus and fails to prioritise user needs through 
              a clear, clean layout.

            <p>
              As the Institute for Internet and the Just Society explains, digital inclusion 
              and exclusion remain urgent issues in South Africa. Over 25% of the population 
              remains offline due to a lack of internet access, digital skills, or devices. 
              A government site must prioritise inclusive design to bridge — not widen — 
              these digital divides.

              “The lack of internet-enabled devices and digital literacy,” both of which 
              are closely linked to poverty, mean that websites like this must meet users 
              where they are. When a site is designed with high data usage, dense content, 
              or complex interactions, it excludes the very people it is meant to serve.

                Language Accessibility:  
              South Africa is a nation rich in linguistic diversity, with 11 official 
              languages. Yet the site is only available in English, failing to accommodate a 
              significant portion of the population who may be more comfortable in isiZulu, 
              Afrikaans, Sesotho, or other languages. The lack of translation features 
              creates an additional layer of exclusion.

              Yuri Shapochka (2025) on UX Design for Crisis Situations regarding multilingual 
              support stresses that government websites must support the public in times of 
              urgency or vulnerability — like applying for birth certificates, death records, or 
              immigration services. If the design isn’t built for those most in need, it’s not 
              ethical.
            </p>
          </section>
     <section class="p-summary">
    <p>
      The DHA’s language policy acknowledges the importance of multilingual
      communication and commits to promoting equitable access through all official
      languages (Department of Home Affairs, 2016). Yet, the website does not reflect
      this commitment in practice. Without language options or translation tools, the DHA
      website fails to serve a significant portion of the population, undermining the principle
      of inclusive service delivery in a multilingual society.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section class="p-issue">
    <p>
        Internet Accessibility and Excessive Image Use:  
      Excessive use of images on a website can make it difficult for users with limited internet
      access or expensive data plans to use the site effectively. Large or numerous images
      increase the overall page size, which leads to longer load times and higher data usage.
      This is especially problematic in South Africa, where many people rely on mobile data
      and have limited bandwidth. When websites are overloaded with decorative or
      unnecessary images, like the DHA is, users may struggle to access important
      information or may abandon the site altogether due to slow loading or high data costs.
      For public service websites like the DHA, this means many citizens, especially those in
      rural or low-income areas, are unfairly excluded from accessing essential services
      online, furthering the digital divide.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section class="p-analysis">
    <p>
      Based on my analysis of the DHA website, I have a few recommendations to improve
      the website. As designers, we need to create inclusive pieces that are widely
      accessible, based on the goals and needs of the people who will be using them. Aparna
      says, <q>When we craft designs, it's crucial to ensure they resonate with a diverse
      audience. That's why accessibility considerations must be at the forefront from the very
      start of the design process. Prioritising accessibility makes our designs usable by
      everyone and creates a sense of belonging among users. It's about creating an inclusive
      environment where everyone feels valued and represented</q> (2024 K.S. Aparna).
    </p>
  </section>
  <section class="p-recommendation">
    <p>
      They need to establish a <strong>Clear Colour Palette</strong>. The website should use a consistent and
      limited colour palette that ensures strong contrast and easy readability. Avoiding too many distracting 
      colours and maintaining uniformity will help users focus and navigate the site more effectively.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section class="p-recommendation">
    <p>
      They also need to <strong>minimise image usage</strong>. Reducing the number of images, especially
      moving or decorative ones, will improve page load times and reduce data consumption.
      This is particularly important for users with limited internet access or expensive data
      plans.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section class="p-recommendation">
    <p>
      To enhance the DHA website's intuitiveness, the DHA should adopt Peep Laja's user-centric 
      approach: 
      <q>Go to your customers and observe them using the web in their
      natural habitat. You’ll get an idea of their current knowledge</q> (Laja, 2022). This
      necessitates conducting in-person usability tests across diverse populations, including
      rural and urban users, to understand their navigation experiences firsthand.
      Furthermore, the DHA should integrate its online services with physical branches to
      reduce system downtime and improve reliability, focusing especially on establishing
      digital service points or online offices in underserved rural areas. By directly observing
      user interactions and creating accessible service points, the DHA can bridge the digital
      divide and tailor its website to meet the real-world needs of all South Africans.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section class="p-conclusion">
    <p>
      In conclusion, the DHA website highlights how digital platforms can unintentionally
      reflect and reinforce existing societal inequalities. Its lack of accessibility, language
      inclusivity, and intuitive design reveals how marginalised communities are often left
      behind in public service digitisation. Ethical digital design in South Africa must go
      beyond technical efficiency; it must be radically human-centred. Future efforts should
      focus on regular accessibility audits, integration of multilingual support and
      optimisation for low-bandwidth environments. By embedding accessibility,
      transparency, and inclusivity into the design process from the start, we can create
      digital spaces that empower rather than exclude. For digital government services to be
      truly transformative, they must be shaped with and not just for the people they serve.
