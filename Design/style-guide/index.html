        <h2>Overview:</h2>
The style guide for my portfolio website is inspired by a clean, comic book aesthetic, designed to be both visually striking and user-friendly. My goal is to create a site that reflects my artistic passion while also ensuring that the design is intuitive, easy to navigate, and professional. I want the site to have bold, dynamic colors, smooth rounded corners, and a minimalistic yet engaging layout that pulls from comic book influences without overwhelming the user.

<h3>Typography:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Primary Font - 'Roboto'</h4></li>
I’ve chosen Roboto for most of the body text and navigation. It's a clean, versatile sans-serif font that’s easy to read on both mobile and desktop platforms. It complements the modern, minimalist style I’m aiming for and ensures that the website remains readable and functional.
<li><a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=roboto"target ="_blank">Roboto</a></li>
<li><h4>Secondary Font - 'Bangers?'</h4></li>
To bring in the comic book vibe, Bangers will be used for headings, titles, and impactful statements. It has a playful, bold style reminiscent of comic book lettering, which helps convey the energetic feel I'm after. It’s a great contrast to Roboto’s simplicity and adds a fun element to the design.
<li><a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bangers" target ="_blank">Bangers</a></li>
<li><h4>Fallback Font - 'Arial'</h4></li>
As a backup, I’m using Arial to ensure that the website maintains its readability and appearance across different devices and browsers. It's a safe, widely supported font that works well with both Roboto and Bangers.
<li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/arial"target ="_blank">Arial</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Color Palette:</h3>

<h4>Primary Colors:</h4>
<ul>
<p><ul>Deep Red (#A81000): This bold red serves as a focal point, drawing attention to key elements like headings, buttons, and calls to action. It’s vibrant and energetic, giving the site a dynamic feel without feeling too overpowering.
Electric Blue (#3498DB): A bright, contrasting blue that pairs beautifully with red. It will be used for interactive elements such as hyperlinks, buttons, and hover effects, making the website feel more engaging.
</ul></p>
<h4>Secondary Colors:</h4>
<p>
  <ul>
Bright Yellow (#F1C40F): A fun, eye-catching color used sparingly to highlight important details like icons, tags, or links. It adds an extra pop to the design and ensures that the most important elements stand out.
Slate Gray (#292f34): Used for background elements and text, this neutral tone will help balance out the vibrancy of the other colors and make the content easier to read. It gives the site a sleek, modern feel.
</ul></p>
<h4>Neutral Colors:</h4>
<p>
White (#FFFFFF): Clean and simple, white will be used for the main background to keep the site feeling open and airy, allowing the bold colors to shine without overwhelming the viewer.

</ul>
<h3>Logo and Personal Branding:</h3>

<p>For my personal logo, I’ve created a digital self-portrait that will be prominently displayed on the website. This digital image represents me in a stylized, artistic form and serves as both a personal and professional brand mark. It’s a creative representation of who I am, and having it as my logo will help create a memorable, unique identity for the website. I’ll place this logo in the header to reinforce personal branding and give the site a distinctive visual anchor.

<h3>Layout and Design Elements:</h3>
<ul>
<em>Rounded Corners:</em>
<p>Rounded corners will be used throughout the site on buttons, containers, and cards to create a smooth, approachable design. It softens the overall aesthetic and adds a modern touch that complements the comic-inspired layout.
</p>
<em>Whitespace and Hierarchy:</em>
<p>I’ve prioritized whitespace to avoid a cluttered feel. By using plenty of space around text and other elements, I’m creating an easy-to-navigate layout. Visual hierarchy is key here—by adjusting font sizes, colors, and placement, I can make sure the most important information stands out and the user’s attention is directed where I want it.
</p>
<em>Mobile Optimization:</em>
<p>The mobile version of the site will follow the same color palette, typography, and rounded corner design but will be optimized for touch interactions. I’m making sure the navigation is simplified with a collapsible menu and larger buttons to make it more accessible on smaller screens.
</p>
<em>Interactive Elements:</em>
<p>To enhance the comic book experience, I plan to incorporate interactive elements like smooth transitions on hover and possibly comic-inspired pop-up effects when users hover over portfolio items. These small touches will add a layer of interactivity, making the browsing experience feel more dynamic and immersive.

  Inspiration Website 
</h3>
<p>
  <li><a href="https://www.alexfisherdesign.ca"
  >Alex Fishers Portfolio Website</a
></li>
<p>While designing my portfolio and my style guide, I took a lot of inspiration from Alex Fisher’s portfolio website. Alex’s clean, minimalist design showcases their graphic design and illustration work in a way that’s both professional and visually appealing. I really appreciate how their site is organized, with clear categories for different types of projects, which is something I aim to replicate in my own design. Their site feels purposeful without being cluttered, and the content is well organized, which ensures that users can easily navigate through the various sections without feeling lost.
</p>
<p>One key feature of Alex’s website that I’m incorporating into my own is the categorization of portfolio pieces. Alex divides their work into specific areas like logo and identity, packaging, editorial illustrations, and more. This helps users immediately understand the focus of each project, and I plan to adapt this structure to showcase my work in distinct sections like game design, animation, and digital art. This comic book inspired layout will still carry that same sense of structure but with a more dynamic presentation that aligns with my artistic style.
</p>
<p>The minimalism of Alex’s website was another major influence. The clean, simple aesthetic allows their work to shine without unnecessary distractions. I want my website to have the same effect—where the focus is entirely on the art and projects I’ve created, with the design elements enhancing the experience rather than overpowering it. The way Alex uses whitespace to create balance is something I’m also implementing on my site, ensuring that the content is readable and easy to follow.
</p>
<p>Another aspect I admire is strong typography—Alex’s use of legible, bold fonts ensures that the text is not only easy to read but also visually interesting. I’m applying a similar approach by using fonts like Roboto for body text and Bangers for headings, ensuring that my website strikes the right balance between modern minimalism and the boldness of comic book aesthetics.
</p>
<p>Finally, the professionalism of Alex’s site, despite its simplicity has shown me that less can definitely be more when it comes to portfolio design. It’s all about letting your work speak for itself while providing a seamless user experience. I want my portfolio to have that same level of polish and attention to detail, ensuring it’s both functional and aesthetically pleasing.
</p>
<p>By drawing from Alex Fisher’s website, I’m hoping to create a site that balances artistic flair with professional simplicity, making it easy for potential clients and collaborators to browse my work and contact me without feeling overwhelmed by the design.
</p>

</p>
<h3>Future Developments with CSS:</h3>

<p>As I move forward with CSS development, the style guide will continue to evolve. I’ll refine things like padding, margins, and responsive design rules to ensure everything looks good on all screen sizes. I also plan to experiment with CSS animations to bring some comic book-inspired flair to the site—maybe transitions that mimic flipping through comic panels or animated illustrations that appear as you scroll.

<p>In the future, I might incorporate scrolling or other animated effects to make the site feel even more like a comic book, but these will be balanced carefully to keep the site user-friendly and fast.
</p>
<p>I think this style guide gives me a strong foundation for my website’s design, i think it blends my artistic passions with professional design principles. As the website develops, I’ll continue to refine and tweak the style guide to make sure it not only reflects my personal brand but also provides a smooth, enjoyable user experience. I’m excited to see how it all comes together as I move on to the CSS stage!
